# MCP Project Reorganization Summary

## Overview

The MCP project has been reorganized to consolidate all essential components in the `core/` directory, improving maintainability and reducing redundancy. This document summarizes the changes made during the reorganization.

## Key Changes

1. **Consolidated Core Components**:
   - All essential MCP components are now located in the `core/src/mcp/` directory
   - Visualization components moved from `src/mcp/visualization/` to `core/src/mcp/visualization/`

2. **Updated Project Structure**:
   - Created `core/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` documenting the new organization
   - Updated main `README.md` with current project information
   - Added proper `__init__.py` files to ensure package imports work correctly

3. **Reorganization Tools**:
   - Created `reorganize_project.py` script to automate file movement and cleanup
   - This script can be extended for additional reorganization tasks

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated documentation to reflect the new structure
   - Added clearer development guidelines

## Directory Structure Before and After

### Before:
```
project/
├── core/
│   └── src/mcp/
│       ├── lobes/
│       ├── neural_network_models/
│       └── ...
├── src/
│   └── mcp/
│       └── visualization/
└── ...
```

### After:
```
project/
├── core/
│   └── src/mcp/
│       ├── lobes/
│       ├── neural_network_models/
│       ├── visualization/  # Moved from src/mcp/visualization/
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. **Import Updates**: Update import statements in files that reference moved components
2. **Testing**: Run comprehensive tests to ensure functionality is preserved
3. **Documentation**: Continue improving documentation to reflect the new structure
4. **Cleanup**: Remove any remaining redundant files and directories

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Simplified Structure**: All core components in one location
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Clearer organization makes the codebase easier to maintain
3. **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate or unused files
4. **Better Developer Experience**: Clearer structure makes it easier for developers to find components
