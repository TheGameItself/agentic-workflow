# 1. CORE IMPLEMENTATION & SYSTEM UPGRADE
- [ ] Systematically upgrade unfinished or stubbed modules (VectorMemory, ScientificProcessEngine, WorkflowManager, DecisionMakingLobe, MultiLLMOrchestrator, AdvancedEngramEngine, ErrorDetectionLobe, PatternRecognitionEngine, MindMapEngine, WebInterface): read, debug, finish stubs, upgrade implementations, add/document fallbacks, update documentation, and reference idea.txt and research.

      `find src/ -type f -name '*.py' | xargs pylint > lint_report.txt`
- [ ] Integrate and document robust fallbacks for all methods in DreamingEngine (async, DB, memory, algorithmic, etc.), ensuring each has at least one reasonable fallback for optimization or error handling. Test all fallbacks.

      `grep -r 'def ' src/mcp/dreaming_engine.py | grep -v 'fallback'`
      `pytest src/mcp/dreaming_engine.py`

      `pytest src/mcp/advanced_memory.py src/mcp/physics/`

- [ ] Continue systematic upgrade and debugging: Proceed to the next unfinished or stubbed module (e.g., VectorMemory backends, ScientificProcessEngine, WorkflowManager, DecisionMakingLobe, MultiLLMOrchestrator, AdvancedEngramEngine, ErrorDetectionLobe, PatternRecognitionEngine, MindMapEngine, WebInterface); for each: read and analyze code, debug, finish stubs/TODOs, upgrade implementations, add/document fallbacks, update documentation, and reference idea.txt and research; ensure all modules are robust, research-driven, and production-ready; regularly update the TODO and documentation to reflect progress and new research-driven improvements.
- [ ] Systematically debug all recently upgraded modules (SimulatedReality, ResearchIntegrator, and dependencies): Review for runtime errors, missing imports, or integration issues; add/fix error handling and fallbacks as needed; test new features (causality modeling, feedback adaptation, research paper analysis) with sample data; log and document all issues and fixes; ensure all changes are robust, production-ready, and aligned with idea.txt; repeat for each module as upgrades continue.
