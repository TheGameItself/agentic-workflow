## üß† **Core Features**

### **How does the memory system work?**

MCP uses a three-tier memory architecture inspired by human cognition:

1. **Working Memory**: Current session context (fast access)
2. **Short-Term Memory**: Recent insights and decisions (days to weeks)
3. **Long-Term Memory**: Persistent knowledge base (permanent)

The system automatically moves information between tiers based on importance and usage patterns.

- **Optimization Evolution**: Improves context generation over time
- **Adaptation**: Adjusts to your changing preferences
- **P2P Sharing**: Shares successful patterns with the community

### **How does P2P collaboration work?**

The P2P network allows MCP instances to share optimizations:

- **Privacy-Preserving**: Only optimization patterns are shared, not your data
- **Genetic Encoding**: Optimizations are encoded like DNA for secure sharing
- **Reputation System**: High-quality optimizations are prioritized
- **Optional**: You can disable P2P features entirely

### **What is context optimization?**

Context optimization generates perfect context for your AI tools:

- **Token Efficiency**: Maximizes information within token limits
- **Relevance Scoring**: Includes only pertinent information
- **Format Adaptation**: Optimizes for specific AI tools
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves based on AI response quality

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **MCP server won't start - what should I do?**

1. **Check system health**: `mcp health-check`
2. **View logs**: `mcp logs --tail 50`
3. **Try different port**: `mcp server --port 3001`
4. **Reset configuration**: `mcp reset-config --backup`

### **Memory usage is too high - how to optimize?**

```bash
# Check current usage
mcp resource-status

# Optimize memory
mcp optimize-system --target memory

# Clear caches
mcp clear-cache --type all

# Consolidate memories
mcp consolidate-memories --aggressive
```

### **Context export is empty or incomplete**

1. **Check project status**: `mcp project-status`
2. **Verify memory content**: `mcp memory-stats`
3. **Try different parameters**: `mcp export-context --max-tokens 1000`
4. **Check task progress**: `mcp task-tree`

### **P2P network connection issues**

1. **Check network status**: `mcp p2p-status`
2. **Try different network**: `mcp p2p-connect --network "backup"`
3. **Check firewall**: Ensure port 10000 is open
4. **Disable P2P**: `mcp configure --disable-p2p` if not needed
