# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec defines the requirements for refactoring the `.core` directory to align with the latest EARS, MerMaidContextProtocol, and automation standards. The goal is to ensure all core scripts, tools, and documentation are modular, maintainable, and fully compatible with CLI, LLM, and Obsidian workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1
**User Story:** As a developer, I want all `.core` scripts and tools to follow a minimal EARS comment header format, so that they remain executable and are easily cross-referenced in automation and documentation.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a new or existing script/tool is added to `.core`, THEN it SHALL include a minimal EARS-format comment header (EARS ID, features, references, backtrack log) as the first comment block.
2. WHEN a script is executed, THEN the EARS header SHALL NOT interfere with its execution or output.

### Requirement 2
**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want all `.core` documentation and protocol files to be EARS and MerMaidContextProtocol compliant, so that they are token-optimized, Obsidian-compatible, and automation-friendly.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a documentation or protocol file is created or updated, THEN it SHALL use 5-letter EARS addresses for actionable items.
2. WHEN a documentation or protocol file is created or updated, THEN it SHALL include an Obsidian footer, cross-links, group/color tags, and a backtrack log.
3. WHEN a documentation or protocol file is created or updated, THEN it SHALL minimize whitespace and optimize for token efficiency.

### Requirement 3
**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all core CLI tools to be invocable from the MCP server, so that automation and orchestration workflows can leverage them directly.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a CLI tool is added or updated in `.core/tools`, THEN it SHALL be invocable via the MCP server's `core_cli_tool` endpoint.
2. WHEN a CLI tool is invoked via MCP, THEN its stdout, stderr, and return code SHALL be returned in the response.

### Requirement 4
**User Story:** As a team member, I want all changes to `.core` files to be traceable and reversible, so that the project remains maintainable and auditable.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a file in `.core` is modified, THEN the change SHALL be logged in a backtrack or changelog section in the file or associated log.
2. WHEN a file is refactored, THEN the previous version SHALL be backed up or archived for recovery if needed.

### Requirement 5
**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want to assess the current state of the project and identify broken, outdated, or non-compliant files in `.core`, so that the refactor plan is comprehensive and addresses all issues.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the assessment is run, THEN it SHALL scan all files in `.core` for EARS, MerMaidContextProtocol, and execution compliance.
2. WHEN a file is found to be broken, outdated, or non-compliant, THEN it SHALL be listed in an assessment report with the reason and recommended action.
3. WHEN the assessment is complete, THEN a prioritized refactor plan SHALL be generated based on the findings.

### Requirement 6
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactor plan to be actionable and tracked, so that each broken or non-compliant file is addressed systematically.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the refactor plan is created, THEN it SHALL include a checklist of files to fix, update, or migrate, with references to the assessment report and requirements.
2. WHEN a file is refactored, THEN its status SHALL be updated in the plan and the change logged.
3. WHEN all items in the plan are complete, THEN the `.core` directory SHALL be fully compliant and functional.

## Speculative Futures

### Speculative Requirement 7: Plausible Future
**User Story:** As a future project maintainer, I want the `.core` directory to support automated, self-healing refactors and compliance checks, so that the system can adapt to evolving standards and recover from drift or corruption autonomously.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a compliance drift or file corruption is detected, THEN the system SHALL propose or enact automated repairs based on the latest EARS and protocol standards.
2. WHEN new standards or protocols are published, THEN the system SHALL notify maintainers and suggest migration paths.

### Speculative Requirement 8: Possible Future
**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want the `.core` directory to be fully interoperable with external AI agents, distributed systems, and speculative design tools, so that the project can evolve in collaboration with other platforms and communities.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an external agent or tool requests access to `.core` data or tools, THEN the system SHALL provide a secure, documented API for interoperability.
2. WHEN distributed or federated workflows are enabled, THEN `.core` SHALL synchronize changes, compliance, and backtrack logs across all nodes.

### Speculative Requirement 9: Preferred Future
**User Story:** As a community member, I want the `.core` refactor process to be transparent, participatory, and continuously improved, so that the project remains resilient, innovative, and inclusive.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a refactor or assessment is planned, THEN the process SHALL be open for community review, feedback, and contribution.
2. WHEN new speculative requirements or risks are identified, THEN they SHALL be documented and integrated into the ongoing refactor and assessment cycles.
3. WHEN the project achieves a new level of compliance or capability, THEN the achievement SHALL be celebrated and shared with the community.
