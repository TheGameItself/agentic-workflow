# Genetic Performance Benchmarking

Genetic performance benchmarking in the MCP system enables quantitative comparison of genetic trigger variants, supporting evolutionary improvement and robust optimization.

## Purpose
- Track and compare activation rates, mutation rates, and fitness scores
- Enable automatic selection of superior genetic implementations
- Support trend analysis and evolutionary adaptation

## Metrics
- **Activation count**: Number of times a trigger activates on a given input
- **Average mutation rate**: Mean mutation rate after mutation events
- **Average fitness**: Mean fitness score after mutation events

## Usage
- Integrated with split-brain A/B testing (`test_split_brain_ab.py`)
- Metrics are collected and logged for both left and right lobes
- Results can be used for trend analysis and implementation selection

## Example
See [[split_brain_testing]] for sample results and interpretation.
