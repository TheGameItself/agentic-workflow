# Advanced Genetic Expression Architecture

The Advanced Genetic Expression Architecture provides sophisticated control mechanisms for genetic system operations, including dynamic execution flow control, cross-lobe communication, and multidimensional task navigation. This system enables complex genetic expressions with interruption points, alignment hooks, and advanced search algorithms.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### Interruption Points
Dynamic execution flow control mechanisms that can pause, modify, or redirect genetic operations based on environmental conditions.

#### Alignment Hooks
Cross-lobe communication and synchronization mechanisms that enable coordinated genetic operations across different system components.

#### Universal Development Hooks
External system integration points that allow genetic systems to interact with external tools, APIs, and services.

#### B* Search Algorithm
Multidimensional hierarchical task navigation using controlled randomness for optimal pathfinding in complex genetic circuits.

#### Condition Chains
Complex gene expression condition chains with dependency resolution and fallback mechanisms.

## Key Features

### Interruption Points

Interruption points provide dynamic control over genetic expression execution:

#### Types of Interruptions
- **Conditional**: Triggered by specific conditions
- **Performance**: Activated by performance metrics
- **Resource**: Triggered by resource constraints
- **External**: Activated by external events
- **Timeout**: Time-based interruptions
- **Error**: Error condition interruptions

#### Usage Example
```python
from mcp.genetic_expression_architecture import (
    GeneticExpressionArchitecture, 
    InterruptionType
)

architecture = GeneticExpressionArchitecture()

# Add performance-based interruption point
def high_cpu_condition(context):
    return context.get('cpu_usage', 0) > 0.8

def throttle_handler(context):
    return {"action": "throttle", "reason": "high_cpu"}

architecture.add_interruption_point(
    "high_cpu_check",
    InterruptionType.PERFORMANCE,
    high_cpu_condition,
    throttle_handler,
    priority=1,
    timeout=30.0
)
```

### Alignment Hooks

Alignment hooks enable cross-lobe communication and synchronization:

#### Hook Configuration
```python
def trigger_condition(context):
    return context.get('synchronization_needed', False)

architecture.add_alignment_hook(
    "cross_lobe_sync",
    source_lobe="genetic_engine",
    target_lobes=["memory_system", "hormone_system"],
    trigger_condition=trigger_condition,
    synchronization_data={"sync_type": "genetic_update"},
    timeout=10.0
)
```

### Universal Development Hooks

Universal hooks provide external system integration:

```python
def external_callback(context):
    # Integrate with external system
    return {"status": "integrated", "data": context}

def validation_function(context):
    return context.get('valid', False)

architecture.add_universal_hook(
    "external_integration",
    hook_type="api_callback",
    integration_point="external_system",
    callback_function=external_callback,
    validation_function=validation_function
)
```

### B* Search Algorithm

The B* search algorithm provides multidimensional hierarchical task navigation:

#### Circuit Navigation
```python
# Define genetic circuit
circuit = {
    "nodes": {
        "start": {"type": "input"},
        "process1": {"type": "computation"},
        "process2": {"type": "computation"},
        "end": {"type": "output"}
    },
    "edges": [
        {"source": "start", "target": "process1"},
        {"source": "process1", "target": "process2"},
        {"source": "process2", "target": "end"}
    ]
}

# Navigate circuit using B* search
path = architecture.scaffold_b_star_search(
    circuit=circuit,
    start="start",
    goal="end",
    dimensions=3
)

print(f"Optimal path: {path}")
# Output: ['start', 'process1', 'process2', 'end']
```

#### Controlled Randomness
The B* search includes controlled randomness for exploration:

```python
# Configure randomness factor (0.0 = deterministic, 0.1 = 10% randomness)
architecture.b_star_randomness = 0.1

# Search with different dimensions
path_2d = architecture.scaffold_b_star_search(circuit, "start", "end", dimensions=2)
path_4d = architecture.scaffold_b_star_search(circuit, "start", "end", dimensions=4)
```

### Condition Chains

Complex gene expression condition chains with dependency resolution:

#### Chain Definition
```python
def condition1(context):
    return context.get('value1', 0) > 10

def condition2(context):
    return context.get('value2', '') == 'test'

def fallback_condition(context):
    return context.get('fallback', False)

# Create condition chain
architecture.scaffold_condition_chain(
    chain_id="test_chain",
    conditions=[condition1, condition2],
    dependencies={"1": [], "2": ["1"]},  # condition2 depends on condition1
    execution_order=["1", "2"],
    fallback_conditions=[fallback_condition]
)
```

#### Chain Evaluation
```python
# Evaluate condition chain
result = await architecture.evaluate_condition_chain(
    "test_chain",
    context={"value1": 15, "value2": "test"}
)

print(f"Chain success: {result['success']}")
print(f"Results: {result['results']}")
print(f"Execution order: {result['execution_order']}")
```

### Reputation Scoring System

Comprehensive reputation scoring for genetic sequences:

#### Score Calculation
```python
# Update reputation score
architecture.update_reputation_score(
    sequence_id="test_sequence",
    performance_score=0.9,
    reliability_score=0.8,
    efficiency_score=0.7,
    adaptability_score=0.6
)

# Get reputation score
score = architecture.get_reputation_score("test_sequence")
print(f"Overall score: {score.overall_score:.3f}")
print(f"Confidence: {score.confidence:.3f}")
print(f"Evaluation count: {score.evaluation_count}")
```

#### Top Performing Sequences
```python
# Get top performing sequences
top_sequences = architecture.get_top_performing_sequences(limit=10)

for seq in top_sequences:
    print(f"Sequence: {seq.sequence_id}")
    print(f"  Overall score: {seq.overall_score:.3f}")
    print(f"  Performance: {seq.performance_score:.3f}")
    print(f"  Reliability: {seq.reliability_score:.3f}")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Execution with Interruptions

Execute functions with automatic interruption point monitoring:

```python
def genetic_function(context):
    # Simulate genetic operation
    return {"result": "genetic_operation_completed"}

# Execute with interruption monitoring
result = await architecture.execute_with_interruptions(
    execution_function=genetic_function,
    context={"cpu_usage": 0.9, "memory_usage": 0.7}
)

print(f"Execution success: {result['success']}")
print(f"Execution time: {result['execution_time']:.3f}s")
print(f"Interruptions triggered: {len(result['interruptions_triggered'])}")
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor system performance and metrics:

```python
# Get comprehensive performance metrics
metrics = architecture.get_performance_metrics()

print(f"Total executions: {metrics['total_executions']}")
print(f"Average execution time: {metrics['average_execution_time']:.3f}s")
print(f"Average interruptions: {metrics['average_interruptions']:.1f}")
print(f"Interruption points: {metrics['interruption_points_count']}")
print(f"Alignment hooks: {metrics['alignment_hooks_count']}")
print(f"Universal hooks: {metrics['universal_hooks_count']}")
print(f"Condition chains: {metrics['condition_chains_count']}")
print(f"Reputation scores: {metrics['reputation_scores_count']}")
print(f"B* graph size: {metrics['b_star_graph_size']}")
```

### Circuit Layout Management

Manage different circuit layouts for various genetic expressions:

```python
from mcp.genetic_expression_architecture import CircuitLayout

# Set circuit layout
architecture.circuit_layouts["genetic_sequence_1"] = CircuitLayout.SEQUENTIAL
architecture.circuit_layouts["genetic_sequence_2"] = CircuitLayout.PARALLEL
architecture.circuit_layouts["genetic_sequence_3"] = CircuitLayout.HIERARCHICAL
architecture.circuit_layouts["genetic_sequence_4"] = CircuitLayout.ADAPTIVE
architecture.circuit_layouts["genetic_sequence_5"] = CircuitLayout.EVOLUTIONARY
```

## Configuration

### System Limits

# Configure system limits
architecture.max_interruption_points = 100
architecture.max_alignment_hooks = 200
architecture.max_universal_hooks = 500
architecture.b_star_randomness = 0.15
```

### Performance Tuning
```python
# Adjust for performance requirements
architecture.execution_history = deque(maxlen=2000)  # More history
architecture.b_star_randomness = 0.05  # Less randomness for stability
```

## Integration Examples

### P2P Network Integration
```python
# Integrate with P2P status visualization
def p2p_health_condition(context):
    return visualizer.current_status.network_health < 0.5

def p2p_optimization_handler(context):
    return {"action": "optimize_network", "reason": "low_health"}

architecture.add_interruption_point(
    "p2p_health_check",
    InterruptionType.PERFORMANCE,
    p2p_health_condition,
    p2p_optimization_handler
)
```

```python
# Integrate with genetic trigger system
def genetic_trigger_condition(context):
    return context.get('genetic_trigger_activated', False)

def genetic_trigger_handler(context):
    return {"action": "activate_genetic_trigger", "trigger_id": context.get('trigger_id')}

architecture.add_interruption_point(
    "genetic_trigger_check",
    InterruptionType.CONDITIONAL,
    genetic_trigger_condition,
    genetic_trigger_handler
)
```

architecture.logger.warning("High execution time detected")
architecture.logger.error("Condition chain evaluation failed")
```

### Performance Analysis
```python
# Analyze execution patterns
execution_times = [exec_info["execution_time"] for exec_info in architecture.execution_history]
interruption_counts = [exec_info["interruptions"] for exec_info in architecture.execution_history]

print(f"Average execution time: {sum(execution_times) / len(execution_times):.3f}s")
print(f"Average interruptions: {sum(interruption_counts) / len(interruption_counts):.1f}")
```
