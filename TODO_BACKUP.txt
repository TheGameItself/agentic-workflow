# === MCP ACTIVE TODO BACKUP (as of latest backup) ===
- Refactor memory architecture: 1) Separate memory into working, short-term, and long-term modules/classes. 2) Move all context-sensitive, feedback, and temporary storage to WorkingMemory. 3) Implement ShortTermMemory for recent, high-priority, or volatile information (e.g., recent tasks, user interactions, session data). 4) Implement LongTermMemory for persistent, structured, and research-driven storage (e.g., vector DB, engrams, knowledge, historical logs). 5) Update all lobes/engines to use the appropriate memory type. 6) Document the architecture and reference idea.txt. 7) Ensure robust fallbacks and extensibility. 8) Update README and docs to reflect the new memory structure.
- Continue systematic upgrade and debugging: 1) Proceed to the next unfinished or stubbed module (e.g., VectorMemory backends, ScientificProcessEngine, WorkflowManager, DecisionMakingLobe, MultiLLMOrchestrator, AdvancedEngramEngine, ErrorDetectionLobe, PatternRecognitionEngine, MindMapEngine, WebInterface). 2) For each: read and analyze code, debug, finish stubs/TODOs, upgrade implementations, add/document fallbacks, update documentation, and reference idea.txt and research. 3) Ensure all modules are robust, research-driven, and production-ready. Repeat until the entire project is complete. 4) Regularly update the TODO and documentation to reflect progress and new research-driven improvements.
- Systematically debug all recently upgraded modules (SimulatedReality, ResearchIntegrator, and dependencies): 1) Review for runtime errors, missing imports, or integration issues. 2) Add/fix error handling and fallbacks as needed. 3) Test new features (causality modeling, feedback adaptation, research paper analysis) with sample data. 4) Log and document all issues and fixes. 5) Ensure all changes are robust, production-ready, and aligned with idea.txt. Repeat for each module as upgrades continue.
