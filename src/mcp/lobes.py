"""
MCP Lobe (Engine) Registry

This module documents and registers all major 'lobes' (engines) of the MCP server,
inspired by the human brain. Each lobe is responsible for a distinct cognitive or
agentic function, and can be extended or replaced for research and self-improvement.

Lobe Manifest:
- MemoryLobe: Basic and advanced memory management (episodic, semantic, vector)
- WorkflowLobe: Workflow orchestration and meta/partial task support
- ProjectLobe: Project initialization, configuration, and alignment
- TaskLobe: Hierarchical task management, dependencies, and progress
- ContextLobe: Context summarization, export, and optimization
- ReminderLobe: Spaced repetition and advanced reminders
- RAGLobe: Retrieval-Augmented Generation and context chunking
- PerformanceLobe: Objective performance monitoring and reporting
- PatternRecognitionLobe: (Stub implemented) Pattern recognition, neural column simulation
- AlignmentLobe: (Stub implemented) Alignment engine for user/LLM alignment
- SimulatedRealityLobe: (Planned) Simulated external reality for deep reasoning

Each lobe is implemented as a class/module in src/mcp/ and can be extended.
