# Memory System Architecture

## Overview

The MCP system implements a sophisticated three-tier memory architecture inspired by human cognitive memory systems. This hierarchical approach optimizes memory usage, retrieval efficiency, and learning capabilities.

## Three-Tier Memory Architecture

### Working Memory
- **Purpose**: Context-sensitive, temporary storage for immediate processing
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Fast access with limited capacity
  - Priority-based item replacement strategy
  - Hormone-sensitive attention mechanisms
- **Use Cases**: Session data, temporary calculations, immediate feedback
- **Implementation**: `src/mcp/lobes/shared_lobes/working_memory.py`

### Short-Term Memory
- **Purpose**: Recent, high-priority, or volatile information storage
- **Characteristics**:
  - FAISS/SQLite hybrid storage
  - Automatic consolidation from working memory
  - Relevance scoring and decay mechanisms
- **Use Cases**: Recent tasks, user interactions, session context
- **Implementation**: Integrated within `ThreeTierMemoryManager`

### Long-Term Memory
- **Purpose**: Persistent, structured, and research-driven storage
- **Characteristics**:
  - Advanced engram compression
  - Association mapping between related items
  - Periodic consolidation and optimization
- **Use Cases**: Knowledge base, historical data, learned patterns
- **Implementation**: Vector databases with compression algorithms

## ThreeTierMemoryManager

The `ThreeTierMemoryManager` class integrates all three memory tiers with automatic transitions and cross-tier optimization.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Tier Transitions**: Based on access patterns and importance
- **Cross-Tier Search**: Unified search across all memory tiers
- **Memory Consolidation**: Automated workflows between tiers
- **Hormone Integration**: Memory operations influenced by hormone levels
- **Genetic Trigger Hooks**: Environmental adaptation through genetic mechanisms

### API Methods
```python
# Add memory to appropriate tier
memory_manager.add_memory(text, memory_type, priority, metadata)

# Cross-tier search
results = memory_manager.cross_tier_search(query, limit=10)

# Consolidate memory between tiers
consolidation_result = memory_manager.consolidate_workflow()

# Get memory statistics
stats = memory_manager.get_memory_statistics()
```

## Enhanced Engram Engine
