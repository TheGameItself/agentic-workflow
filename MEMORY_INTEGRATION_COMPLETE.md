# Three-Tier Memory Integration and Coordination - COMPLETE

## Task 1.5.4 Implementation Summary

✅ **COMPLETED**: Complete three-tier memory integration and coordination

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Unified ThreeTierMemoryManager Integration
- **Integrated Components**: WorkingMemory, ShortTermMemory, and LongTermMemory into unified ThreeTierMemoryManager
- **Cross-tier Optimization**: Automatic memory tier selection based on access patterns, priority, TTL, and data characteristics
- **Unified Interface**: Single interface for all memory operations across all tiers

#### 2. Automatic Memory Tier Transitions
- **Access Pattern Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of access patterns for intelligent tier management
- **Automatic Promotion**: Items accessed frequently are automatically promoted to higher tiers
- **Tier Selection Logic**: Smart tier selection based on:
  - TTL (Time To Live) - short TTL → working memory, long TTL → long-term memory
  - Memory type hints (immediate, persistent, cache, knowledge, etc.)
  - Priority levels (high priority → long-term storage)
  - Data size (large data → long-term storage)
  - Access frequency patterns

#### 3. Cross-Tier Search and Retrieval Optimization
- **Enhanced Cross-Tier Search**: `cross_tier_search()` method with tier weighting and optimization
- **Tier Weighting**: Working memory gets highest priority (1.0), short-term (0.8), long-term (0.6)
- **Recency Bonus**: Recently accessed items get priority boost in search results
- **Duplicate Elimination**: Intelligent handling of same keys across different tiers
- **Search Order Optimization**: Smart search order based on access patterns and hints

#### 4. Memory Consolidation Workflows Between Tiers
- **Comprehensive Consolidation**: `consolidate_memory()` method with multi-phase workflow
- **Working → Short-term**: Items accessed 3+ times and aged >1 hour or >24 hours old
- **Short-term → Long-term**: Items accessed 5+ times and aged >1 day or >7 days old
- **Consolidation Scoring**: Priority-based scoring system for consolidation candidates
- **Demotion Logic**: Rarely accessed items are marked for potential demotion
- **Metadata Preservation**: Consolidation metadata tracked for audit and optimization

#### 5. Hormone System and Genetic Trigger Integration
- **Hormone Integration**: 
  - Vasopressin release on memory storage and consolidation (memory consolidation hormone)
  - Growth hormone release on tier promotions
  - Serotonin release during optimization (satisfaction/completion hormone)
- **Genetic Trigger Integration**: Environmental evaluation on all memory operations
- **Context-Aware Signaling**: Rich context passed to hormone and genetic systems

#### 6. Advanced Statistics and Health Monitoring
- **Comprehensive Stats**: Extended statistics including tier transitions and consolidation metrics
- **Health Assessment**: `get_memory_health()` with tier-specific health scores and recommendations
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed tracking of consolidation candidates, transitions, and usage patterns
- **Lobe Usage Tracking**: Cross-lobe memory usage monitoring for system optimization

#### 7. Performance Optimizations
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All operations use RLock for thread safety
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient resource usage with on-demand loading
- **Access Pattern Optimization**: Smart caching and retrieval based on usage patterns
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of expired items and old access patterns

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Core Classes and Methods Enhanced:
```python
class ThreeTierMemoryManager:
    # New/Enhanced Methods:
    - consolidate_memory(force=False) -> Dict[str, Any]
    - cross_tier_search(query, context, limit, tier_weights, lobe_id) -> List[MemoryItem]
    - get_memory_health() -> Dict[str, Any]
    - _find_working_consolidation_candidates() -> List[tuple]
    - _find_short_consolidation_candidates() -> List[tuple]
    - _consolidate_working_to_short(key, score) -> bool
    - _consolidate_short_to_long(key, score) -> bool
    - _get_tier_transition_stats() -> Dict[str, Any]
    - _get_consolidation_stats() -> Dict[str, Any]
    - _calculate_tier_health(tier, stats) -> float
    - _generate_health_recommendations(stats) -> List[str]
```

#### Integration Points:
- **Hormone System**: Integrated with vasopressin, growth hormone, and serotonin signaling
- **Genetic Triggers**: Environmental evaluation on store, retrieve, consolidate, and optimize operations
- **Vector Memory**: Automatic vector representation storage for semantic search
- **Cross-Lobe Communication**: Lobe usage tracking and cross-lobe memory sharing

#### Memory Tier Selection Logic:
1. **Explicit Tier Hint**: Takes precedence if provided
2. **TTL-Based**: ≤1 hour → Working, ≤1 week → Short-term, >1 week → Long-term
3. **Memory Type**: immediate/session/temporary → Working, recent/volatile/cache → Short-term, persistent/knowledge/research → Long-term
4. **Priority-Based**: ≥0.8 → Long-term, ≥0.5 → Short-term, <0.5 → Working
5. **Size-Based**: >10KB → Long-term, >1KB → Short-term, ≤1KB → Working
