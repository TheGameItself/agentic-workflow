# Documentation Map

## Epic
**As a** user or contributor
**I want** a clear, up-to-date map of the documentation and system structure
**So that** I can easily navigate, understand, and maintain the project

## Overview

The Documentation Map provides a visual and conceptual overview of the entire Agentic Workflow documentation and system architecture. It is implemented as an interactive Obsidian canvas and is systematically updated to reflect all major features, groups, and navigation paths.

## Map Structure

### Main Groups
- **Mind Map**: System architecture and relationships between all major components
- **Self Improvement Process Map**: Visualizes the self-improvement workflow and feedback loops
- **Documentation Map**: Shows the structure and cross-links of documentation files
- **Build FileTrees**: Visualizes the file and directory structure for build/deployment

### Key Features Represented
- **Neural Network Models**: Dedicated nodes and links for self-improving neural systems, integration, and performance
- **Core Systems**: Memory, hormone, genetic, and pattern recognition systems
- **Navigation Hubs**: Getting Started, User Guides, API Docs, and more
- **Process and Testing**: Feature Test Suite, development, deployment, and performance

## Navigation Guidance
- Use the Mind Map for a high-level overview of system relationships
- Follow links from Documentation Map nodes to quickly find relevant docs
- Explore the Self Improvement Process Map for understanding feedback and optimization loops
- Use Build FileTrees for insight into the project structure

## Canvas Reference
- The canonical map is maintained in [[../Maps.canvas|Maps.canvas]] and is systematically updated to reflect the true project structure, requirements, and design.
- All major modules, lobes, and systems are represented in the canvas, with cross-links to code, requirements, and design docs (see .kiro/steering and mcp-system-upgrade/specs).

## Systematic Update Process
- The map is updated using scripts that reference the actual codebase, requirements, and design files.
- All changes are validated for accuracy and completeness, and feedback is incorporated from contributors.

## Cross-References
- [[../Maps.canvas|Maps.canvas]] - Canonical interactive map
- [[../MCP-System-Mind-Map-Guide.md|Mind Map Guide]] - How to use and maintain the mind map
- [[../Documentation-Index.md|Documentation Index]] - Complete documentation index
- [[../MCP-Feature-Test-Suite.md|Feature Test Suite]] - Comprehensive test suite for MCP features
- [[../../.kiro/steering/structure.md|Project Structure Reference]]

- [[../../.kiro/specs/mcp-system-upgrade/design.md|Upgrade Design]]
- [[../../.kiro/specs/mcp-system-upgrade/requirements.md|Upgrade Requirements]]

## Continuous Improvement
- The map is regularly updated as new features and documentation are added
- All nodes and links are validated for accuracy and completeness
- Feedback and suggestions are welcome for further refinement

## Kiro Spec-Driven Development Reference
- The [Kiro Comprehensive Guide](../../kiro_comprehensive_guide.md) and [Kiro Internal Rules](../../kiro_internal_rules.md) are foundational for all project requirements, design, and task planning.
- All new features, requirements, and design changes should be cross-checked with these guides for alignment and inspiration.
- Contributors are encouraged to review these guides before proposing or implementing changes.
