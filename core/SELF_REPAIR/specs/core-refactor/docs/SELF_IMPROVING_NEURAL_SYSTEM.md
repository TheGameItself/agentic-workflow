3. **Execution**: Improvement tasks are executed using various strategies
4. **Evaluation**: Improved models are evaluated against performance metrics
5. **Integration**: Successful improvements are integrated into the system
6. **Feedback**: Hormone responses and genetic triggers are updated

## Implementation Details

### SelfImprovingNeuralSystem

The core class that manages the recursive self-improvement process.

```python
class SelfImprovingNeuralSystem:
    def __init__(self, hormone_integration, genetic_system, hormone_system, brain_state):
        # Initialize system components
        self.hormone_integration = hormone_integration
        self.genetic_system = genetic_system
        self.hormone_system = hormone_system
        self.brain_state = brain_state
        
        # Improvement tracking
        self.iteration = 0
        self.total_improvements = 0
        self.improvement_history = []
```

### Hormone-Driven Optimization

The system uses biologically-inspired hormone levels to influence optimization decisions:

```python
def _calculate_task_priority(self, model_id: str, performance: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
    base_priority = 1.0
    
    # Hormone influence
    hormone_levels = self.hormone_system.get_hormone_levels()
    
    # High dopamine increases priority for reward-seeking improvements
    if hormone_levels.get('dopamine', 0.5) > 0.7:
        base_priority *= 1.5
    
    # High cortisol increases priority for stress-related improvements
    if hormone_levels.get('cortisol', 0.3) > 0.6:
        base_priority *= 1.3
    
    return base_priority
```

### Genetic Algorithm Integration

Genetic triggers influence optimization targeting:

```python
def _get_current_environment(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    environment = {
        'system_load': 0.5,
        'memory_usage': 0.3,
        'error_rate': 0.01,
        'task_complexity': 0.6,
        'user_interaction_level': 0.4
    }
    
    # Get active genetic triggers
    active_triggers = self.genetic_system.get_active_triggers(environment)
    
    return environment
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# Create self-improving system
system = SelfImprovingNeuralSystem(
    hormone_integration=hormone_integration,
    genetic_system=genetic_system,
    hormone_system=hormone_system,
    brain_state=brain_state
)

# Start self-improvement
await system.start_self_improvement_loop()

# Force improvement cycle
await system.force_improvement_cycle()

# Get status
status = await system.get_improvement_status()
```

### Integration with MCP

```python
# Create integration
integration = SelfImprovementIntegration(
    enhanced_mcp=enhanced_mcp,
    config=SelfImprovementConfig(
        enabled=True,
        auto_start=True,
        improvement_interval=300.0,
        hormone_driven=True,
        genetic_enhanced=True
    )
)

# Initialize
await integration.initialize()

# Add custom improvement task
await integration.add_custom_improvement_task(
    model_id='hormone_dopamine',
    improvement_type='training',
    priority=1.5
)

# Optimize specific model
await integration.optimize_specific_model('pattern_recognition', 'auto')
```

### Monitoring and Analysis

```python
# Get improvement status
status = await integration.get_improvement_status()

# Get improvement history
history = await integration.get_improvement_history(limit=50)

# Get model performance
performance = await integration.get_model_performance('hormone_dopamine')

# Generate health report
health_report = await integration.get_system_health_report()

# Export data for analysis
export_data = await integration.export_improvement_data()
```

## Performance Metrics

### Improvement Tracking

The system tracks comprehensive metrics for each improvement:

```python
@dataclass
class SelfImprovementMetrics:
    iteration: int
    models_improved: int
    total_improvement: float
    best_performance_gain: float
    average_training_time: float
    hormone_levels: Dict[str, float]
    genetic_activations: int
    memory_usage: float
    timestamp: datetime
```

### Health Metrics

System health is calculated based on multiple factors:

- **Overall Health**: Weighted combination of efficiency, stability, and learning rate
- **Improvement Efficiency**: Average performance gain per improvement
- **System Stability**: Consistency of improvement success rate
- **Learning Rate**: Rate of performance improvement over time

## Configuration

### SelfImprovementConfig

```python
@dataclass
class SelfImprovementConfig:
    enabled: bool = True
    auto_start: bool = True
    improvement_interval: float = 300.0  # 5 minutes
    max_concurrent_improvements: int = 3
    performance_threshold: float = 0.1  # 10% improvement required
    hormone_driven: bool = True
    genetic_enhanced: bool = True
    cross_model_distillation: bool = True
    model_backup_enabled: bool = True
    improvement_history_size: int = 1000

    # Transfer knowledge from teacher to student
    # Use soft targets, attention transfer, and feature mapping
    # Preserve knowledge while improving efficiency
```

### Genetic Architecture Evolution

Genetic algorithms optimize model architectures:

```python
async def _evolve_model_architecture(self, model_id: str, task: ModelImprovementTask):
    # Use genetic algorithm to evolve architecture
    # Optimize layer structure, activation functions, regularization
    # Balance performance and efficiency
```

### Self-Supervised Pretraining
