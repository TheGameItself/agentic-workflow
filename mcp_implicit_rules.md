# MCP System Upgrade - Implicit Rules

## Development Workflow
- Follow spec-driven development workflow for the MCP system upgrade
- Implement tasks in order from the tasks.md file
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing MCP architecture

## Implementation Principles
- Use both algorithmic and neural network implementations for key components
- Implement hormone-based cross-lobe communication
- Create genetic trigger systems for environmental adaptation
- Provide comprehensive monitoring and visualization
- Optimize resource usage based on workload patterns
- Implement security and threat detection mechanisms

## Architecture Guidelines
- Follow brain-inspired architecture principles
- Use async/await for non-blocking operations
- Maintain type hints throughout the codebase
- Keep file sizes under 2000 lines
- Use brain-inspired naming conventions

## Core Patterns
- Implement both code and neural solutions for critical functions
- Use hormone-inspired signaling for cross-lobe communication
- Implement genetic-like mechanisms for environmental adaptation
- Follow a three-tier memory structure
- Implement A/B testing via left/right lobe folders

## P2P Network Architecture
- Local-first functionality that works offline with sync-when-available
- Privacy-first with multi-stage sanitization pipeline
- Use 256-codon system for genetic encoding
- Implement hierarchical network with dynamic chain of command

## Advanced Genetic Features
- Implement dual implementation strategy for all genetic functions
- Use performance tracking for automatic implementation selection
- Provide fallback patterns when neural networks fail
- Support hot-swapping for runtime switching
- Implement A/B testing for genetic algorithm comparison
