## July 2025: Pruning of Experimental Stubs

- All obsolete or duplicate stub classes (SimulatedReality, DreamingEngine, SpeculationEngine, etc.) were removed from experimental_lobes.py.
- experimental_lobes.py is now deprecated and preserved only for migration history and test compatibility.
- All active development and stubs are now modularized in src/mcp/lobes/experimental/.
- This improves clarity, maintainability, and aligns with the modular, research-driven architecture described in idea.txt.
